Plan for project: 

Sentiment analysis using the IMDBDataset. 

Step 2a: Identify or construct a solution based on a generative probabilistic model. 
Describe the model in detail and develop a solution using parameter inference (and/or decoding).

Naive Bayes

Step 2b: Identify or construct a solution based on a discriminative neural network. 
Describe the network structure in detail and develop a solution using gradient descent.

LSTM or GRU model.
