# ECE684 Project Fa23

The LSTM_GRU notebook performs hyperparameter search for the LSTM model. The utils file contains the training pipeline used for the LSTM_GRU notebook. The naive_bayes_clf notebook plots the relevant figures for the Naive Bayes classifier; in addition, it also cleans up the synthetic dataset. The synth_data file contains the Python script for generating synthetic data. Change the relevant file name in each file to either train/test using the synthetic or the real-life dataset (line 407 in utils and at the top of the naive_bayes_clf Notebook). 
Use the environment_droplet.yml to install the conda environment for this project.
